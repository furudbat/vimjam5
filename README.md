You are auto-running on the main map, if you reach an obstacl, solve the Microgame.
Keep running until you reach the Exit.
Keep a good distance from the the Beast, if it catches you, it's Game Over.
Don't let the Timer run out or bad things will happen.

### Controls

Every Microgame have a little introduction at the start, <kbd>LMB</kbd> (left-click) to start the Microgame.
Most of the Microgames are solvable by clicking on something, keep an eye on special mouse and control promts like <kbd>RMB</kbd> or <kbd>mouse wheel up/down</kbd> (for example to rotate something).

Use <kbd>LMB</kbd> to click through the Prolog (Comic) or hold <kbd>RMB</kbd> to skip.
